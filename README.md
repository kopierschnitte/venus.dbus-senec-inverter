# dbus-senec-inverter
Integrate the internal inverter readings of a Senec Home storage system into [Victron Energies Venus OS](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus)
In order to see more realistic values, battery (dis)charging is also taken into account:
The currently charged power is subtracted from the inverter power and discharged power is added. Therefore, the entire system acts as an inverter as long as the internal inverters are producing energy or the battery is being discharged.

It can be used in concert with my other script [venus.dbus-senec-enfluri](https://github.com/kopierschnitte/venus.dbus-senec-enfluri) to fully integrate a Senec Home system into Victron's ecosystem.

## Purpose
With the scripts in this repo it should be easy possible to install, uninstall, restart a service that reads the current values of Senec Home's internal inverters and publishes them to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.
Idea is pasend on @RalfZim project linked below.

## Inspiration
This project is my first on GitHub and with the Victron Venus OS, so I took some ideas and approaches from the following projects - many thanks for sharing the knowledge:
- https://github.com/RalfZim/venus.dbus-fronius-smartmeter
- https://github.com/victronenergy/dbus-smappee
- https://github.com/Louisvdw/dbus-serialbattery
- https://community.victronenergy.com/questions/85564/eastron-sdm630-modbus-energy-meter-community-editi.html

## How it works
### My setup
- Senec Home v3 Duo Hybrid storage system
  - ABB EnFluRi meter, connected to the Senec system using Modbus/RS485
  - 3-Phase installation (normal for Germany)
  - IP 192.168.37.123/24  

### Details / Process
As mentioned above the script is inspired by @RalfZim fronius smartmeter implementation.
So what is the script doing:
- Running as a service
- connecting to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.pvinverters.http_40`
- After successful DBus connection, readings are accessed via an unsupported/undocumented API of the Senec system (lala.cgi)
- Serial is taken from the response as device serial
- Paths are added to the DBus with default value 0 - including some settings like name, etc
- After that a "loop" is started which polls Senec/EnFluRi data every 1000ms from the REST-API and updates the values in the DBus

Thats it ðŸ˜„

## Install & Configuration
### Get the code
Just grap a copy of the main branch and copy them to `/data/dbus-senec-inverter`.
Edit the config.ini file and fill in the IP of your Senec Home
After that call the install.sh script.
